# Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of a collection of nodes (or vertices) and edges
    # (or connection between the nodes). More formally a Graph can be defined as a
    # Graph consisting of a finite set of vertices(or nodes) and a set of edges that connect a pair of nodes.
    
# Example of Graph Data Structure:
# Function to add an edge between two vertices
def addEdge(adj, u, v, w):

    adj[v].append((u, w))
